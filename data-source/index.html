    <h1>Glossary & Data Source</h1>

        <p class="introduction-paragraph">
        In our geoplotics game, we focus on 12 key variables that define a country's influence, neatly divided into Hard Power and Soft Power. <br> <br> Hard Power encompasses the measurable might of a nation: economic power, military strength, and state capabilities proxied by government revenue. Soft Power, on the other hand, captures cultural influence and global perceptions. Incorporating fun variables such as pet ownership and box office into Soft Power assessments adds a dimension that reflects a nation's lifestyle and societal quirks. These variables, often overlooked, can significantly influence global perceptions and cultural appeal. <br> <br> As the world changes, so will our analysis. We're committed to regularly updating and adding new variables, ensuring our insights stay sharp and relevant.

                        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Trade balance as a percentage of GDP is a pivotal hard power indicator, reflecting a nation's economic interaction with the global market. A favorable balance, where exports exceed imports, signifies a country's strength in producing goods and services in demand worldwide. This economic prowess enhances its geopolitical influence, as trade relationships often translate into strategic alliances and diplomatic leverage. Essentially, a strong trade balance showcases a nation's capacity to assert economic power and shape international economic dynamics.</p>
