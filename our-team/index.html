            <p>Hi! My name is Sam and I’m from the U.K. but originally from Malaysia. I studied Chemistry in Durham University, then taught English in Japan as part of the JET Programme. Following this, I joined PepsiCo UK’s Future Leaders Programme, a sales graduate scheme fast-tracking professionals through the business. I left PEP this year to study a Master’s in Education Policy at the Harvard School of Ed, so here I am!</p>
