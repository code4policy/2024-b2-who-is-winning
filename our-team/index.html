            <h3><strong>Sam Ho</strong></h3>
            <p>Hi! My name is Sam and I’m from Cambridge, U.K., but I'm originally from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I studied Chemistry in Durham University, then taught English in Japan as part of the JET Programme. Following this, I joined PepsiCo UK’s Future Leaders Programme, a sales graduate scheme fast-tracking professionals through the business. Despite loving PepsiCo, I decided to leave to follow my passion for education, resulting in my decision to study a Master’s in Education Policy at the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 2023. <span style="color: #264653;font-weight:bold;">When I'm not coding, I enjoy wondering what's wrong with my code.</span></p>

            <h3>Mustafa Rasheed</h3>
            <p>Hello - I'm a graduate student at Harvard Graduate School of Education, studying Education Policy and Analysis. After transitioning from law to education, for the last 3 years, I have worked with organizations like Pratham and Teach for India to support their government partnerships. Currently I am consulting for the School Education Department of the state of West Bengal, working directly with the Principal Secretary’s office to help them operationalize key programs and aspects of their recent State Education Policy, 2023. <span style="color: #264653;font-weight: bold;">When I'm not coding, I enjoy sitting by a wishing well and longing for a better life.</span></p>
